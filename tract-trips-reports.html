thy name give glory, for thy mercy, [and] for thy truth’s sake.” <br><br></em>By God’ s wonderful grace we made it safely to Seville, and were able to go out this evening to pass out tracts. All the tracts were ready on time, for which we thank God for. Here are a few highlights: <br><br>One man with his girlfriend was reading the tract that he had been given by another one of the team members. He saw another female team member who was passing by, and he called her over as he had some questions about what the tract meant. The team member told the man that the world is  under God’s judgment, and for him to go “ebiblefellowship.org” The man was very excited and said he would go to the website, and keep reading the tract. <br><br>Another British woman and her husband was given a tract inside the hotel, and said she would read over the tract, and that she hoped she would see the female team member who gave her the tract tomorrow. Another man who was a waiter was standing outside of his restaurant reading a tract and asked another team member who was passing by what it was all about. The team member responded by saying it was information from the Bible, and directed the man to E Bible ‘s website, and he said he would.  <br><br>Another encounter involved a group of 10-year-olds who were playing, and one of them asked one of the team members’ what her shirt signified. She explained that it was information from the Bible, and one of the boys asked, “Why do I need it?” And she replied, “ It’s good for your soul.” And the boy replied, “ Well in that case, I’ll take one.” <br><br>Thank you for your continued prayers for us, which we are so grateful for.  <br><br><strong>In Christ, <br>The E Bible Fellowship Team in Seville, Spain</strong></p></div></div><div class="slide-28 w-slide"><div><h1 class="heading-15">SUNDAY, DAY 2</h1><h3 class="heading-16">May 5, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em>“Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded; Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.” (Jeremiah 50:2)  <br><br></em>One of the groups went to the Cathedral, and it was quite slow. One of the team  members gave a tract to a young woman who immediately began reading  it and then approached two other team members looking very troubled ,and asked the team leader “may I ask you a personal question.” And he said, “sure.” She explained the she was gay and her parents threw her out of the house ,and then asked “why does God hate gays.” The team members shared that God hates all sin, and began to list a number of them. The young lady then said, “why.” And they explained “because God is holy.” She went on to ask , “why can’t God be gay.” The team leader replied “because God created  man in His image, then instituted marriage between a man and a woman, and thirdly, homosexuality is prominently displayed throughout the Bible as a sin, even though one person’s sin, is no worse than somebody else’s. The team leader encouraged her to study the Bible, and she said “what do you mean study the Bible,”  because I read the Bible. The leader continued: “pray to a God for wisdom as it is the Holy Spirit who teaches, as you compare “spiritual with spiritual, “ or Scripture with Scripture, and don’t trust me. She was very attentive as the leader then went on to share more about various study tools that a God has provided, such as Strong’s Concordance, and Jay P. Green’s Interlinear Bible. She was hungry for information and  had a more questions.  They continued speaking for another 15 minutes, during which she listened very intently, and the team leader pointed her to the ebiblefellowship.org website, YouTube, and Facebook links, underscoring that questions like hers could be typed into Sunday’s Q &amp; A. She left clutching the tract, and was thankful.  <br><br>Another team member reported: “I saw a young man leaning on the rail, so i approached him asking, “habla espanol,” or do you speak English. He said English. I asked where are you from.  He said he was from New York. I pointed to Osvaldo, who was from the same state and city, so I gave him an English tract. He asked me, “what was it about?&quot;  I said, have you noticed the turmoil in the world? The strife that exists in all areas of life. I am older than you and I can tell you it has gotten far worse and will continue this way...<em><br><br></em>The verses from the Bible in this tract will help you to understand these things.  Another team member said that they went to a place to eat as they were quite tired, and at this particular restaurant, they said that they could not sit down, and even said they could not offer any chairs to the team either. So they decided to go to another restaurant. At the second restaurant a young man was very helpful and accommodating. He immediately asked what denomination the team was a part of, and one of the Spanish speaking members informed him that they did not belong to any denomination, because God had ended the church age, and we only look to the Bible for truth. The young man kept insisting, “but what denomination are you a part of,“ and commented that “all the churches say  they have the truth, and all are after money, and the reason I know this is because I happen to be the son of an evangelist.” Another team member began to hand him a tract, and he declined, saying, “I have two, that I have already read.”  <br><br>Thank you for your prayers on our behalf that God will enable us to feed His sheep in Seville, by His mercy<em>.  <br><br></em><strong><em>The E Bible Fellowship Team in Spain</em></strong></p></div></div><div class="slide-28 w-slide"><div><h1 class="heading-15">MONDAY, DAY 3</h1><h3 class="heading-16">May 6, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em>The glory of the LORD shall endure forever: the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. (Psalm 104:31) <br><br></em>We thank God for another day and the opportunity to share His Word with the dear people of Seville, amongst whom we trust God has His beloved sheep that need to be fed. We have found a good reception rate overall here, and most people politely receive the tract, but we have also noticed clear animosity to the Bible’s message as well, as some will take a tract, and then out of spite immediately throw into a trash receptacle, as happened to one of the team today. We have also noticed tracts torn up into little pieces by people who were undoubtedly angered by the verses in the tract, or trash cans stuffed with tracts. Some display their hatred for God’s Word by the looks of disgust or waving their hands as if to say, “Get away, I want nothing to do with what you are offering.” There was also another man (an ardent Catholic) that just wanted to argue vehemently, but the team members involved just walked away, realizing that the communication was not in the least fruitful. <em><br><br></em>By contrast, others stopped to ask a few questions, and responded positively to the message of the tract, and expressed their gratitude to the team member for taking the time to answer their questions.  Here are some more highlights from today’s distribution:  Juan Antonio, a young man of about 22-25 years of age, talked to one of the team. He had a wrist band that read “protestant Reform,” but said he was going to a Baptist church. He spoke Spanish and limited English to two of the team members, and made every effort to convince them that he was a brother in Christ. One of the team expressed to him that this was not unlike Paul, when he spoke of Jews at times, calling them “brethren,”  but if they would not heed his words, that they really did not belong to Christ. Also he repeated numerous times  that he was  a Christian by using Luke 9:50 as a proof text: <br><br>“<em>And Jesus said unto him, Forbid [him] not: for he that is not against us is for us.” <br><br></em>The team member tried to explain that he agreed that the Lord said this of those who were baptizing outside of the disciples themselves, but was interrupted by the young man’s efforts to speak in English. The team member mentioned he may think himself as one, but God could use even a donkey to accomplish His will. Sadly, Juan was completely focused on his presumed identification with Christ by virtue of his Baptist church; he also may have had a partial impairment of sorts. He cordially went on his way thereafter, as many do, whom God has blinded to the truth of Scripture, reminding one of those who say in Luke 13:25, “.<em>..Lord, Lord, open unto us...” </em>and hear the awful sentence,<em> “...I know you not whence ye are,”  <br><br></em>One of the teams went back to the Féria de April, or the Seville Fair this evening, where hundreds of small tents house private food and drink parties for all ages, and everybody is dressed up very nicely, and many  in traditional Spanish attire from little children to the elderly. Near the entrance to the Fair, a young man in his late teens approached one of the team members to ask what the tract was all about. When he found out he got very excited and shared the tract with some of his other friends, and then came back to ask if he could get some more tracts to pass out, which the team member gladly gave him; he then came back again to request some more to pass out.  We praise God for His guidance and direction in leading us to those of His choosing, knowing that He truly does all things perfectly according to His divine will. <br><br><span>May He continue to strengthen us physically as well as spiritually to accomplish our task here in Spain. </span> <br><br><strong>The E Bible Fellowship Team in Seville, Spain</strong></p></div></div><div class="slide-28 w-slide"><div><h1 class="heading-15">TUESDAY, DAY 4</h1><h3 class="heading-16">May 7, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em>“So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?

Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.&quot; (John 21:15-17)  <br><br></em>Today was a very productive day, by God’s mercy as the team concentrated on a few different areas of the city - one group went to the Seville Fair, while the other focused on another area of town called Macarena, and then later in the early evening moved to the bullfighting ring, known as the Plaza de Toros, or “Plaza of the bulls.” This venue draws large crowds of men, women, and children, and as customary, dressed in their “Sunday best,” and so there were many vendors in front of the four entrance doors selling seat cushions, hats, water and snacks, and gypsies who aggressively approached men to give them a sprig of rosemary, telling them of its health benefits, and then reading their palms, and asking them for a donation in return. The group that went to the bullfighting ring, then proceeded to walk down the main boulevard that parallels the river, to a very busy spot by a bridge that was teeming with people. One highlight of the day for that team was a man that had approached one of the team on a bicycle, and asked a number of questions, and seemed interested in what we were sharing, and he agreed to carefully read the tract at home, and was told that if he had more questions he could go to the various E Bible websites and other links that are listed on the back of the tract. A photo of the conversation will be posted to Facebook, Lord willing.  Both teams encountered a good reception rate, and were able to empty out their backpacks, and return to the hotel.  <br><br><strong>The E Bible Fellowship Team in Seville Spain</strong></p></div></div><div class="slide-28 w-slide"><div><h1 class="heading-15">WEDNESDAY, DAY 5</h1><h3 class="heading-16">May 8, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em>&quot;To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; {8} To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; {9} To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.&quot; (Psalm 149:7-9)  <br><br></em>We were told by the hotel manager that today would be the busiest day of the Seville Fair, as many of the stores in the vicinity of the Fair would be closed. So the team separated into two groups as we have been doing since we started. The one group focused on the area of the Fair; the other on the busy area north of the Fair.  Here are the wonderful encounters that our gracious LORD sovereignly arranged today:  One man (in his late twenties) had parked his motorcycle near one of the team members, and the team member had noticed that there was a tract on the ground near him, so she went to pick it up, and he asked for one. Then he began reading it all the way though, and commented that it was very interesting, and in the end stated to the team member,  “Viva nuestro Rey, Jesu Cristo por siempre! “ or Glory to our King, Jesus Christ forever!  This same team member also met a young woman (about 25) who took a tract, and said she wanted to come back later to discuss it with the team member. When she did, they had a wonderful conversation in which this  young lady shared that she had  gone to church as a youngster, but then went into the world, but found no answers there, so her focus was exclusively on the Word of God, as she stated, “the churches are full of lies.” The team member said that from their conversation, it really seemed that this young lady was one of God’s elect, as she had a desire to wholeheartedly follow the Scriptures, and live her life to the LORD.  <br><br>Another incident involved a couple with their children, and the wife did not want the tract, but her husband took it gratefully and replied, “We need to read this to find out why the world is so divided!”  <em><br><br></em>Another female team member offered a tract to a young man in his ‘20’s , who sat down and quietly read it for some time. He was deep in thought and looked sad, and watched the team pass out tracts for a good while. However, after a bit, the team member  looked around and did not see him any more and began to pray that the LORD, having had mercy, might have mercy, according to God’s perfect will.  Another woman approached one of the team members with a tract that she had been given, and exclaimed: “Everything in here is true, the world is bad today, and it will only get worse.”  <br><br>On another note, in a previous report, a young lesbian woman was mentioned, and yesterday she showed up again to get another Spanish and English tract, as her friend only spoke Spanish. Please pray for her.  A young man came up to the team leader, excitingly waving a tract in his hand which he had gotten from a female member of the team. He said &quot; This is right, this is right!&quot;. Then asked &quot; How much are they paying you..“ The team leader responded, “Nothing, we do it because we believe that the Bible is the Word of God, and we are to  be obedient to God in sharing this information.” The young man then said, &quot;This must be very hard to do, “ then patted the team leader on the shoulder, shook his hand, and then  exuberantly bounced away.  A female member of  the team suddenly found herself in the middle of a dense crowd as two double buses pulled up and emptied out.  A man a few people away saw the tract and began straining to reach for it over the crowd, and finally got it, clutching it between both hands. The team member noticed that his hands were both  swollen, with the right hand deformed in a claw shape with a half cut-off finger. A few minutes later, the team leader felt someone poking him in the back. He turned around to find the same man holding out the tract with both hands as if he were returning it. When the team leader reached to take back the tract, the man would not let it go,  shaking his head no. Then he  pulled the tract back,  opened his deformed hand as best he could, placed the team leader&#x27;s hand into it, and smiling , shook his hand and walked away.  <br><br>We are confident that you are indeed rejoicing with us as you read about these individuals that God had orchestrated for us to meet today, and for which all of us have been beseeching our dear LORD for, before, during, and after this tract trip. <br><br>May God alone be magnified and glorified for such kindness.  <em><br><br></em><strong><em>By His grace, <br>The E Bible Fellowship Team in Seville, Spain</em></strong></p></div></div><div class="slide-6-spain w-slide"><div><h1 class="heading-15">Thursday, Day 6</h1><h3 class="heading-16">May 9, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em>&quot;And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? {14} And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&quot; (Revelation 7:13-14)  <br><br></em>Today was our last day in Seville, so the team leader and one of our Spanish speaking team members had to make arrangements to ship some boxes of tracts up to Madrid, since we are going there tomorrow by a high speed train. We were told that the print shop in Madrid had problems with their equipment, so they were unable to print the tracts we needed, but then we were informed that they were up and running again. However we did not want to be in a position of having no tracts, which is why we mailed the boxes to our hotel in Madrid. You would think that this would involve a couple of phone calls to accomplish this, but we are used to speed and efficiency in the US, but that is not always the case when one is abroad, and even when one speaks the language. This process involved many phone calls both to the UPS store as well as to the printer in Madrid, and even the hotel tried to help with the phone calls, as the calls were dropped, or the number was wrong, or the party on the other line thought the conversation was over, and hung up. In the end, by God’s mercy, everything worked out as He intended for our good, reminding us once again of Romans 8:28, that in spite of circumstances, our mistakes, and other unforeseen events that crop up, we can go to our Heavenly Father, knowing that He is completely in control, and is ten steps ahead of us, so to speak.  <br><em><br></em>Seville has a number of tree lined boulevards, bridges, and the Guadalquivir River that winds its way though the center of town. On the streets, one sees and hears many sounds: bustling traffic, frequent ambulance and police sirens, riders on horseback in traditional costumes, horse drawn carriages with elegantly dressed men at the reins with anywhere from two to five horses - beautifully groomed and festively clad with flowers - prancing in the streets. It is a very colorful city, accentuated by the traditional dresses of the women in every imaginable hue, who seemingly are either being photographed by somebody else or taking “selfies” of themselves with their cell phones. In spite of the festive atmosphere, a fellow team member remarked, “nobody seems happy here.” And we know that for the world their happiness is bound up in <br><em><br>“...the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life...” (1 John 2:16); </em>however for the child of God, the<em> “joy of the LORD is [their] strength.” (Nehemiah 8:10)  <br><br></em>Both teams returned to the very busy Seville Fair, as this area is jam packed with well dressed men, women and children heading toward the Fair. We had another good day of tract distribution, and a number of the team emptied out their backpacks  fairly quickly, so two team members took a cab back to the hotel to get some more tracts. Here are some of the highlights from today’s distribution:  On one occasion, the team leader was passing out tracts and dropped a tract, and while bending (very slowly) to pick it up,  a man came over and picked it up. The team leader was expecting him to hand it to him when the man  began waving the tract in the tract in the  air, thanking him as he walked away. Later on, the  team leader dropped a number of tracts and and was scrambling to pick them up before the wind took them. There was one tract left to pickup when a man rushed and scoped it  up. The team leader said thank you and the man responded, thank YOU, and walked away with the tract.  <br><br>Another female team member reported that while she was working, a woman came approached her with a tract that she had received previously, and began to tear it up into little pieces, and so the team member opened up her hand so that the woman would not throw the little pieces down on the ground, as were are very careful in picking up those from the ground in order to be a “good witness” here in Seville.  You might recall that in yesterday’s report, a young lady (around 25) was mentioned. She came back again today, asking if she could join the team for dinner, which led to a wonderful discussion of God’s Word between her and the other three Spanish speakers on the team. Please pray for her, her name is Isabel.  <br><br>Last, but certainly not least, one of the team members was approached by two police officers, who asked to see her identification, and informed her and the team that we had to move up a few blocks away from the Fair. Both officers also asked to read the tract, and responded with alarm by saying, “This message is too hard for us to hear!!” Ironically, we were reminded of the same words in <br><br>John 6:60, “...<em>This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</em>”  <em><br><br></em><strong><em>The E Bible Fellowship Team in Seville, Spain</em></strong></p></div></div><div class="slide-28 w-slide"><div><h1 class="heading-15">Friday, Day 7</h1><h3 class="heading-16">May 10, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em>&quot;And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. {30} And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.&quot; (Luke 13:29-30)  <br><br>This morning we left Seville by high speed train to go to Madrid to commence the second half of our tract trip here in Spain.  By God’s mercy, we were able to hand out 38,000 tracts while we were in Seville.  Prior to getting to the train station, we had to take four cabs in order to fill the 10 team members, and all of our luggage. One of the team had an interesting conversation with cab driver, and gave him a tract, when he commented on the shirts we are wearing, which reiterate the title of the tract: WHY IS THE WORLD SO DIVIDED? <br><br>The cab driver was thinking that we were saying that there were many opposing factions in the world, such as political conservatives, or liberals, or independents. The team member explained that what the tract was highlighting is that Satan - the ruler of this world - was defeated by the Lord Jesus Christ, and the entire world is under His wrath, except for God’s elect. The team member went on to quote Matthew 12:25, which states  that Satan’s kingdom is now being divided, as various institutions  - who were once admired such as those in the media, politicians, sports figures, and the entertainment industry,  and worldwide religions to name just a few - are now being shamed in the eyes of the world.  After arriving in Madrid, we checked into our hotel, had lunch, and then walked towards the printer which was about 35 minutes away,  since we had to find out if he had tracts for us or not, as he had mechanical issues. Along the way, we passed out tracts as we walked on one of the main thoroughfares in Madrid, as our hotel is located in an excellent location near downtown Madrid. When we reached a huge park, our team leader and one of our Spanish speaking team members went by themselves to the printer. The rest of us split up into two groups to cover the park. In the park we saw joggers, people on electric skateboards, roller bladers, and others who were walking or riding bikes; some were reading books on the grass, or sitting on park benches. It was encouraging to see some who sat intently reading the tract for a good while.  <br><br>Another team member reported that he and a colleague were approached by four young girls, one of which spoke English and another who have difficulty communicating in English that would ask her girlfriend to pose a question to the team leader; the team leader proceeded to motion to the other team member who submitted this account. He said, “When the team leader motioned me over I started listening to their conversation I stepped in at the point where she looked at the team leader and myself, saying  “Do you hate 2 men getting married? I responded by saying that we don&#x27;t hate them. But it is sin like stealing and murder. God did not make them that way. Today everyone wants what they want. They don&#x27;t want to do what God wants. The team leader explained that a genuine child of God wants to follow God&#x27;s Word - the Bible. The other team member also told the young ladies that they could ask any question in Spanish about the Bible as well.  We continue to covet your prayers for the team in Madrid - both physically and spiritually - that God may be glorified as we bring this message to His people here.  Rejoicing in Him, <br><br></em><strong><em>The E-Bible Fellowship Team in Madrid Spain</em></strong></p></div></div><div class="slide-28 w-slide"><div><h1 class="heading-15">Saturday, Day 8</h1><h3 class="heading-16">May 11, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em>“And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.”(Revelation 10:11)  <br><br>Near our hotel is a very large plaza, called Puerta del Sol, or “Door of the Sun.” This particular plaza is fed by ten or so extremely busy streets that are packed with so many people that our entire team spent all day here, and practically gave away all the tracts we had brought with us. There were three different demonstrations in the plaza throughout the day; the last one invited a significant police presence as it was a very large protest with banners and balloons to legalize marijuana.  Madrid, as you can imagine is a bustling, cosmopolitan city, and quite different from provincial Seville. The reception rate is lower here than Seville, but the enormous sea of people make up for it. The atmosphere is also different, as one would see in any large city, like New York or Los Angles: more tattoos, piercings, a very obvious gay presence, and more homeless people.  <br><br>One of the team met a middle-aged man, who went to church but was very interested in the tract, and the man asked many good questions, and the team member spoke with him for a good  twenty minutes, as best he could in Spanish, covering topics such as “judgment... [began]...at God’s house” (1 Peter 3:17), the nature and duration of the Great Tribulation, the beginning of the church age on the Day of Pentecost, God working in conjunction with His people to reach the “nations of the elect” prior to May 21, 2011, and the “New Commission” that God has given to His elect in our present day of judgment to spiritually “feed” God’s elect with the Word of God, and to declare that the world is under God’s just wrath. The man showed great interest and had even more questions, so the team member decided to introduce him to one of the Spanish speaking team members across the street, so that the discussion could continue in unbroken Spanish. This team member also warned the man that because he was part of a church, he should really question his salvation. In the end, it turned out that the man had relatives in Lima, Peru during the same time frame that E-Bible Fellowship will be engaged in the Lima, Peru Mission Trip (from July 25 - August 7, 2019).  <br><br>As was mentioned in an earlier report, the printer in Madrid had machinery problems, and was only able to print up 8,000 tracts for us, which we are scheduled to receive on Monday. We had some left over tracts from Seville, but we are likely to run out early, Lord willing. We had also shipped a large box of tracts from Seville which should also be arriving on Monday. We might have to get another printer quickly if for some reason this printer is unable to print up more tracts for us, so please keep this in prayer, that God will meet this need as well.  <br><br>“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.

We also witnessed a small musical parade, in which the participants were dressed in traditional Spanish dress. The other much larger group was attended by the police, and it was an actual demonstration. One team member asked a bystander about the purpose of the protest and learned that it had to do with sanitary conditions regarding blood donations. Incidentally, we have included two short videos of each of these events, that will also be posted on EBF’s Facebook group. The entire team divided the tracts we had on hand, and then we split up into two teams until it was time to break for lunch. After a nearby lunch we again split up the remaining tracts, and went back to the Plaza until we had none left. We then walked back to our nearby hotel to rest, pray, study, and listen to E-Bible’s Sunday Study, Q &amp; A, and the beautiful hymns that are all a part of the Sunday programming, for which we thank God for. I did receive an additional report from yesterday, which took place during the marijuana protest. One of the team encountered a group of five men,<br>Here are some of the highlights from today’s distribution:<br><br>One of the team met an elderly woman who spoke Spanish but thankfully the team member got the gist of her comments which were quite telling: She said, “these are very critical questions and I’m taking the tract to read to my children.”<br><br>Another team member was asked by a man named, Jarson, “what is this about.” Then he took a tract. This same team member also reported that a 94-year old woman reached out to receive a tract, and then turned to remark, “I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on in the world, but I will read this.”<br><br>One team member reported that she was about to pick up a tract that she saw on a marble platform that was part of a nearby subway exit but procrastinated a bit as she saw that the tract was still clean; she then noticed a woman who saw the tract, and then picked it up to read, and after she had finished reading it, walked away with it. This same team member mentioned that she also handed out a tract to an elderly woman (whom she later learned was 82), who did not take it, and stood nearby watching the team member pass out tracts. After five minutes or so she came back over, and said, “I’ll take the tract,” and told her to keep up the good work, as most people are so hard-hearted.<br>‍<br>We are so grateful to the Lord for the individuals that we find from time to time, carefully reading the tract, or coming back to tell us that they appreciate the contents of the tract; these encounters are indeed a great source of encouragement for each of us on the team, and really serve to confirm the fact that God has us here to reach His beloved sheep. Furthermore, we recognize time and again, that every aspect of this tract trip is according to the Lord’s divine guidance and direction, and always for His honor and glory exclusively.<br><br>By His wonderful grace,<br><br></em><strong><em>The E-Bible Fellowship Team in Madrid, Spain</em></strong></p></div></div><div class="slide-28 w-slide"><div><h1 class="heading-15">Monday, Day 10</h1><h3 class="heading-16">May 13, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><strong><em><br></em></strong><em>“Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. {21} For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.&quot; (Isaiah 26:20-21)  <br><br>Today we discovered that the printer did not have the tracts ready, and told us that we would have them between 4-7 PM this afternoon. Moreover, the box that we had mailed from Seville had not arrived either. The team had very few Spanish tracts, so it was decided to pass out the English tracts, and then if somebody came back to request a Spanish one, we would give them one. This worked surprisingly well, and by lunch time, we had given away 3/4 of our initial supply. In the meantime we received word from the hotel that the box of tracts from Seville had arrived; additionally we heard back from the printer that the tracts were done, but it was almost closing time for them, so they requested that we stop by in the morning, which we agreed to do. After lunch, we divided the remaining 1/4 tracts so that each team member had the same amount; the plan was to hand all these out first, and then return to the hotel, divide up the box of tracts between everybody, and go out again until late. <br><br>Today one team stayed in the Plaza del Sol, while the other went to a nearby plaza, called Plaza Mayor, or “Major Plaza, ” where a concert stage had been set up, which was to take place, as we found out, later this evening.  Here are some of the conversations that the Lord allowed to take place:  Two team members spoke to a man and his wife briefly that had taken a tract; we also recorded part of the conversation which another team member had filmed.  <br><br>Another team member recounted that a young man had approached with a tract that another team member had given him. He was quite excited and spoke very good English, and the exchange in both Spanish and English went on for about 20 minutes. This young man’s name was Diego, and he was in his late twenties; he told the team member that he did not go to any church, but he was hopeful that God had saved him, by His grace from a life  of drugs, drink, and debauchery, which is the lot of so many in our world, as he put it. He went on to states that he did not understand why God had saved him, and not somebody else, which was really refreshing to hear. Diego also mentioned that he was feeling a bit depressed earlier and had prayed that God would allow him to meet another like minded believer, which revealed part of his excitement in finding the team member. A number of items were discussed, including the Biblical timeline, the Great Commission during the day of salvation, the nature of the day of judgment, along with the “New Commission” for the day of judgment, God’s methodology for studying the Bible, the spiritual significance of both “the man of sin,” and the “mark of the beast,” E-Bible’s website, and the importance of being a good Berean, etc. In the end Diego wished God’s continued blessing on the team, and His divine guidance during our stay in Madrid. The team member told Diego that before and during the trip many had been praying that a God would indeed lead the team to those elect that He wanted us to meet. How truly faithful our Lord is!  <br><br>Some time later in the evening, one of the team was stopped by a police officer who told him that he was not to hand out tracts to passers by, but rather hold the tract up, and let the people who want one, come up to the me. The team member informed the leader and the team what the officer had said,and decided to move to the Plaza Mayor that one of the teams had visited earlier in the day. Those of us who have been on previous tract trips have learned that when things like these happen, it is because God is directing us elsewhere, where there are “sheep” that need to be fed, and so we willingly comply, trusting in God’s perfect guidance and sovereignty so that His will - not ours - will prevail. <br><br>When we arrived at the Plaza, the concert was very crowded, so that we were unable to move through the crowd, but we managed to circle the perimeter of the large square, to pass out tracts, in full sight of many police officers who were stationed at this event. We had brought from the US, 4700 English tracts, and by the end of the day, had given away practically all of them.  Lord willing, tomorrow, we will pick up the 8,000 Spanish tracts  from the printer, and the few we had left from today, to pass out on Tuesday and Wednesday, as we fly home on Thursday morning. <br><br>Please pray that God’s perfect will be done.  By His enabling, <br><br></em><strong><em>The E-Bible Team in Madrid Spain</em></strong></p></div></div><div class="slide-28 w-slide"><div><h1 class="heading-15">Tuesday, Day 11</h1><h3 class="heading-16">May 14, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><strong><em><br></em></strong><em>&quot;And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. {35} For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. {36} Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.&quot; (Luke 21:34-36)  <br><br>Today the team divided up the remaining tracts and headed out to two other locations in the city, where the reception was fairly steady. We had heard that tomorrow was going to be a holiday, as well as the last day of the San Isidro Festival, in honor of the patron saint of Madrid. So the team leader found a copy center that printed 4,000 tracts in preparation for the event. We picked these up around 8 PM, went to eat at a local restaurant next to the hotel which we have regularly frequented, and then had a tract folding party until 11:30 PM, when the restaurant closed. By God’s grace, all the tracts were folded and bundled ready for tomorrow.  Here are some highlights from today’s distribution:  <br><br>One of the team recounted that as he was standing by a busy corner, near the closet lane of traffic, two garbage men in a truck who were stopped at a red light, motioned that they wanted tracts; three other cars also did the same. <br><br> Another team member who was stationed at the entrance of one of the largest parks in Madrid said that his female partner (who only spoke a little Spanish) sent over a woman who was talking excitedly, to speak with him. After a few minutes, it became very evident that this woman was making the point that “we needed to belong to a church,” to which the team member replied, all churches and denominations throughout the world, came under the wrath of God on May 21, 1988. The woman seemed to ignore the team member’ statement and insisted on repeating her position, to which the team member replied, “this is what the Bible teaches, and it’s pointless to argue about it,” after which the woman walked away. This same team member also reported that he ran into a similar situation, only with a man (who might have been a pastor or deacon), and also was pointing out that the tract was wrong about the date of May 21, 2011, and of course he adhered to Bishop Ussher’s flawed calendar. He also proceeded to share some websites with the team member, but the team member indicated that he was not interested, as his interpretation of a number of doctrines that he was espousing were not based on “comparing spiritual with spiritual.”  Curiously another team member said that he too, ran into a couple men on two separate occasions, who were also part of a church, one of whom was very well versed in Scripture, but again flawed in his understanding that Bible is to be understood spiritually first and foremost. As we witness the spiritual blindness that so many are engulfed in, the elect child of God realizes what an enormous privilege that God has afforded to His people by giving them spiritual insight, as we read in <br><br>Luke 24:45, “Then opened He their</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.”  <br><br>Thank you for your continued prayers as we prepare for our last day of sharing God’s Word in Spain. As always, our constant prayer is that God may be magnified in all we say and do.  <br><br></em><strong><em>The E-Bible Team in Madrid Spain</em></strong></p></div></div><div class="slide-28 w-slide"><div><h1 class="heading-15">Wednesday, Day 12</h1><h3 class="heading-16">May 15, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><strong><em><br></em></strong><em>&quot;For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: {25} But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.&quot;(1 Peter 1:24-25) </em><strong><em> <br><br></em></strong><em>Today the team headed to the area in which the conclusion of this six day Festival of the patron saint of Madrid was took place. It centers around a church that bears his name, and a very large park that is adjacent to the church, where  people gather to eat lunch on the grassy knolls. We thought Plaza del Sol was exceptionally busy, until we went to this park, or“pradera, “which signifies “meadows” in Spanish. We were greeted with a veritable  “sea” of people which grew so large  that one felt almost claustrophobic. The main street where this takes place is lined on one side with food and drink stands, and special donuts in honor of this man,  who is revered by Catholics to be a presumed “saint.” God’ s elect, however, know that a genuine “saint,” is simply one who has been born from above, during the day of salvation. <br>Overall, the atmosphere was more akin to an “Oktoberfest” with lots of beer, music and dancing. It was well covered by Madrid’s radio and TV stations, and of course a very large police presence.  Here are some highlights from today’s distribution:  The team leader, while on his way  to breakfast and  “tracting,” met a middle -aged Spanish woman in the elevator of the hotel. Enthusiastically, she began pointing at his“Why is the World so Divided”shirt, speaking in Spanish, and making gestures of approval. When he went to hand her a tract,  she refused saying “no, no,” but then continued to express approval of our efforts. A bit confused, the team leader again offered a tract which she refused again. The team leader was perplexed. Just as the elevator was stopping at her floor, she turned and gestured, speaking  excitedly in Spanish, and communicated that she had received a tract yesterday and read it.  Then smiling and making  more motions of approval, she got off the elevator. The leader praised God for this incident, as it was such a wonderful encouragement to start the last day of our trip.  <br><br>By contrast, a little later in the day, the following encounter was reported: During a demonstration in Plaza del Sol, many tracts were given out. The team leader gave a tract to two women who were carrying a sign from the demonstration that was unfolding in the Plaza. They walked away reading it for  a moment, then one of them rushed back angrily and giving the tract back yelled at him, “This is a political demonstration!&quot;   The world is so concerned with so called “freedom” - be it political, financial, or one’s physical well bring - not realizing their own spiritual bankruptcy, as the Lord Jesus so clearly revealed in John 8:36 during the day of salvation: <br><br>“If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”  <br><br>Another team member reported that he had met a man who had asked for a tract, and wanted to know if we were being sponsored by a church, as he was not part of a church, to which the team member responded, “we are not.”  In closing, the team is tremendously grateful to our Heavenly Father  for the many blessings, provision, and safety during our time in Spain. Please continue to pray for the individuals that we have encountered that they might be fed and nourished by the Bible studies and other programming on E-Bible Fellowship’s website and Facebook groups. We thank each of our brothers and sisters in Christ for upholding the team in prayer over the course of these last two weeks. <br><br> “To the only wise God</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>our Saviour, [be] glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.

After breakfast some of the men went to the printer to pick up the 50,000 tracts we had ordered, which is conveniently located around the corner from our hotel. We praise God for leading us to this printer who did such a superb job! The tracts were beautifully folded and packaged in bundles of 100, with an easy to read typeface on semi-gloss paper, making them easy to pack into our backpacks and to distribute.<br>We then went out for half a day, and were very pleasantly surprised to find that the tracts were very well received. This bustling city is even busier than usual due to the Pan-American Games which are taking place here over the next few weeks, along with the celebration of Peru’s day of Independence. One team headed toward the Stadium and downtown to a very busy intersection, where one could even see the fireworks display from the opening ceremonies, and tracts were distributed at a very strong pace (at least 90%) with only a few on the ground.<br>‍<br> One interesting occurrence happened to the Team Leader, as he was engaged in passing out tracts: he and his team were headed to the Stadium where the opening ceremonies were scheduled to take place later in the evening. At a certain point they could go no further because of a very large police presence who had blocked the road so no vehicles or pedestrians could get through, as the City must be on a high security alert to avoid any possible threats to locals and the many foreign athletes and spectators that are visiting Lima. As they were turning around to go back the way they had come, the team leader felt a tapping on his arm with a stick and immediately turned around. As he did so, a a short elderly woman that apparently had been trying to catch up with him smiled and with outstretched hands motioned that she wanted a tract as well. This special moment really underscores the purpose of this tract trip and the “new” commission that God has given His elect to carry out in the day of judgment.<br>‍<br></em><strong><em>The E-Bible Fellowship Team in Lima, Peru</em></strong></p></div></div><div data-w-tab="Tab 2" class="tab-pane-tab-1-15 w-tab-pane"><div class="container-9 w-container"><h1 class="heading-15"><strong class="bold-text-29"> DAY 2 - LIMA</strong></h1><h3 class="heading-16">July 27, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em>“</em><strong><em>And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. {5} And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.” </em></strong><em>(John 10:4-5)<br>‍<br>Here are a few more encounters that happened yesterday, which some of the team recounted: <br>One of the team mentioned that when he returned to the hotel he saw a young woman that he had given a tract to earlier in the day, who likewise recognized him and exclaimed, “You are the one who gave me the tract!” With a fellow team member who helped to translate, he found out that the young woman was from Chile, and said she was a Christian. They spoke for awhile, and he was able to give her a Spanish copy of  “Yet Forty Days.”<br>Another team member who spoke Spanish reported that he had a discussion with the taxi driver who took a part of the group from the airport to our hotel, and besides giving him a tract, also gave him a copy of “Yet Forty Days” as well, which they had been talking about in the cab, and the taxi driver remarked, saying, “I have never heard this information.”<br>As the team checked into the hotel, tracts and “Yet Forty Days” booklets were given to the front desk clerk and to the doorman as well.<br>One team member mentioned that he had given a tract to two ten-year old boys, who immediately sat down to read the tracts very intently.<br>Near our hotel as some of the team were stopped at a red light, there was a caravan of 10 empty tour buses or so, and one of them happened to be going just slow enough for one of the team to reach up and hand the driver a tract.<br>               _______________________________________________________________________<br>‍<br>Today, our second day in Lima, we felt was especially blessed, and we are so, so, grateful for many of you that are praying for us, that God would bless our efforts as we continue to lean upon Him moment by moment. Truly, “...the joy of the LORD is [our] strength”(Nehemiah 8:10) is a precious reminder of God’s gracious care and concern for each team member individually, and as a group. We feel confident that God is solemnly orchestrating  His plan to reach the elect here in Lima with the truth of His blessed Word, and as always to glorify His dear Son. We are indeed honored, blessed, and humbled to be here, as we read in Psalm 149:9, “To execute upon them the judgment written: this </em><strong><em>honour </em></strong><em>have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.”<br>Here are some highlights from today’s tract distribution:<br>‍<br>Each day we inevitably run into a number of people that are curious about the title of the EBF tract, “Why Is The World So Divided.” And this gives the Spanish  speakers on the team, the opportunity to answer this question, and at the same time, share some of the main points in the “Yet Forty Days” booklet. <br>One of the places we visited this afternoon was Plaza San Martin, which was the location of the hotel where we stayed in 2015. As always this Plaza is bustling with shoppers, tourists, and frequently is a hotbed for non- violent protests of various sorts, and today was no exception, as we witnessed quite a crowd that filled the center of this very large square. To ensure that the protest remained “peaceful” we also saw a dozen police officers dressed in riot gear in single file at the head off the Plaza, keeping a watchful eye on what was taking place in the Plaza. Immediately one of the female team members set out to present each officer with a tract and a smile, which they all gladly accepted. Between Plaza San Martin and the next major Plaza, called Plaza  de Armas, (which houses the seat of government and the residence of the Peruvian President) there is a long pedestrian-only street, which is always jam-packed with people. The Plaza de Armas was filled with guards armed with rifles, on each of the four sides of the square, yet practically each one that we encountered took a tract and thanked us. We quickly realized that the police in Lima were open to receiving the tracts, and many of them thanked us. Two team members  in the same vicinity also met two Park Police - a man and a woman, who introduced themselves as Carlos and Vanessa, who asked what we were handing out, and after one of our Spanish speakers explained our purpose, they remarked that what we were doing was so much better than the churches, who were “always after money.”<br>‍<br>The other curious thing is that cars will honk if the driver wants a tract to get the attention of one of the team members. This can be somewhat confusing, however, since so many drivers honk quite a bit to begin with, so one has to be especially vigilant to look for a wave from one of the drivers trying to do just that. <br>One team member met a woman who received a tract, and then stopped immediately to read it. He also pointed out the websites on the back of the tract, and she immediately went to the website, and for the next 20 minutes she read the tract, and went to the website. A similar incident happened with a man who was very grateful for the information, and at the end of their conversation, pulled out a Bible from his backpack, and pointed toward Heaven.<br>‍<br>A female team member reported a similar incident in which she had given a tract to a woman, who proceeded to sit nearby and read the tract intently for about 30 minutes; every once in a while, she would look up at the team member and nod. This team member kept a eye on her, and then she got caught up with a horde of people asking for tracts, and was temporarily distracted. Then she heard somebody shouting, and it was this same lady who was frantically motioning her to come over to her. When she did, she excitedly asked for more tracts, which she gave her, and also reminded her to go to the website, which she did for the next half hour! This same team member met a young man who worked at a Cultural Center, who asked what the tract was all about. She answered him and encouraged him to read the tract carefully and to visit the website, and he said, “Yes, I will.” This same team member also recounted that on the plane trip over to Lima, she had met a Peruvian man that spoke excellent English, and had been living in Florida, who asked her what she was going to be doing in Peru. She responded that she was going to pass out tracts, and he asked her what that meant. He then replied that things were “bad” in the world, and she gave him an EBF magnet, and encouraged him to check out the website.<br>‍<br>The team leader mentioned that he was approached by three teens - a woman and two men - who had already been handed a tract, and wanted to know who we were and what the tract was all about. One of the men spoke pretty good English, and wrongly concluded that our solution to the “world being divided,” was some kind of “unification.” The leader had to correct him, and said, “No, things will only get worse,as man’s unrestrained sin continues unabated,” which they reluctantly accepted. He also asked when the world might end, to which the team leader responded that 2033 was a very good possibility, given that many verses in the Bible pointed to that date.<br>‍<br>Another female team member said that she met a man who had also been given a tract previously, and he asked her if she was doing this on her own. She replied by letting him know that she was working for the LORD, and he smiled and thanked her.<br>‍<br>Overall, many of the team were approached by individuals wanting more tracts, as well as demonstrating their appreciation for what we were doing, by sincerely thanking us, shaking our hands enthusiastically, or patting us on the back. We thankGod for these expressions of good will, but at the same time we realize that we are not looking for the commendation of men, but only for the LORD’s commendation, and to remain faithful to His Word.<br>‍<br></em><strong><em>The E- Bible Fellowship team in Lima, Peru</em></strong><em><br><br><br><br></em></p></div></div><div data-w-tab="Tab 3" class="tab-pane-tab-1-15 w-tab-pane"><div class="container-9 w-container"><h1 class="heading-15"><strong class="bold-text-32">DAY 3 LIMA</strong></h1><h3 class="heading-16">July 28, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><strong><em>“Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. {6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”</em></strong><em>(Proverbs 3:5-6)<br><br>‍</em><em><br>Today we split up into two teams as we normally do, and one of the teams headed to a location in the city called Miraflores, which is very close to the beach (Pacific Ocean). We took a cab there from our hotel, and told the driver whose name is Gustavo, that we would call him, when we needed to go back to the hotel. We began passing out tracts for a short while when we were told by a policemen that we could not pass out tracts on the street we were on. So we went a up a block or so to a roundabout that 4 or 5 others streets fed into, and proceeded to hand out tracts there instead, and we got quite a good response. However, then one of our Spanish speakers and his partner walked over to tell the rest of us that he had spoken to another police officer that informed him that in the district of Mirafloresit was prohibited to pass out any kind of pamphlets period. At that point we gathered that the LORD already had brought those of His choosing to receive the tracts, and  was now setting us on a new course. We then called Gustavo (our cab driver)  to let him know that our plans had changed, and to take us to one of the busiest places in Lima, known as the Centro Commercial, or “Commercial Center, which was about 40 minutes away in the northern part of Lima.This place  was a sight to see and must have covered an area about the size of 6 blocks squared in every direction. What was even more amazing were the numbers of people that entered this mega mall, not to mention that there were two major bus stops that were dropping off and picking up hundred of people at a time with no lag time whatsoever; at these two stops, there were two crosswalks that led to two separate entrances to the mall, which is where we had positioned ourselves, since we could not distribute on mall property. Near these bus stops, was a very long line of vendors selling everything from donuts and coffee to scarves, hats and gloves. (It’s winter here in the Southern Hemisphere.) The following are some highlights from today’s distribution, by God’s grace:<br>‍<br>One of the vendors was an elderly woman who upon receiving a tract, immediately opened it up, and began reading it carefully - front and back - until she finished reading all of it. Near the buses is a line of cabs as well, and one of the taxi divers motioned (as many are wont to do here) that he wanted the tract, which the team member gladly gave him. As the team member continued passing out tracts, he kept an eye on this man who very intently read one side of the tract and then turned it over to read the other, and then sat there for awhile, and seemed to be deep in thought.<br>‍<br>Another team member met a man and his wife who were Pentecostal preachers, and they had a good conversation in which he reminded them that a woman is to be silent in the church, according to 1 Corinthians 14:34, much less that God had finished using the churches and denominations as of May 21, 1988. Part of their conversation centered around the word “all” as these folks adhered to a free will gospel in which God wants “all” to be saved, which is of course patently false. The team member informed the couple that to determine the correct interpretation of a word in the Bible, one needed to use a Concordance in order to examine all the ways that God employs that term in Hebrew as well as in Greek, by the divine methodology that God prescribes in 1 Corinthians 2:13, of comparing “spiritual with spiritual.” The husband look surprised, and remarked, “You know a lot!” do which the team member humbly replied, “ I know nothing.”<br>‍<br>The other half of our team returned to the very busy Plaza San Martin and the the long pedestrian-only street,Jiron de la Union, which runs into the Plaza de Armas. They reported the following encounters:<br>One female team member related that she met three young men in the Plaza San Martin, whom she gave tracts to, and one of them spoke excellent English. They were very excited to receive the tracts, and she spent awhile conversing with them, while hundred of people passed in front of her, so she had called for another team mate to continue passing out tracts, while she spoke with the three young men, and encouraged them to visit the website for more information. This same team member noted that every day people were coming up to her, asking for tracts, holding their hands out, or trying various ways to get her attention, which was being divided because there were so many people clamoring for a tract. Curiously this team member who lives in Manasses, VA met an American couple who were from her home town, and she directed them to EBF’s website as well. One person asked this same team member where she was from and she replied, “</em><a href="http://ebiblefellowship.org/" target="_blank"><em>ebiblefellowship.org<br>‍</em></a><em>, “ so as not to bring attention to her, but rather to keep the focus on the ministry.<br>Another female team member mentioned this incident in which a young man her if we were sharing the Gospel, to which the team member replied, “yes.” He said he had “accepted Christ” recently, and had a lot of questions, as he was looking for a church. The team member said she would get a fellow male colleague to speak to him, and here is what transpired next: the team member said he kept coming back to the idea that he had to join a church, and the team member explained why it would be important </em><strong><em>not </em></strong><em>to. The young man brought up Hebrews 10:25 about three times, and the team member patiently explained that the verse  was not talking about “forsaking” the churches, but not forsaking one’s relationship with God and the Word of God. The team member went on to tell him to not take his word for it, but to “prove all things” as the Bible instructs. In the end, the team member felt that their conversation had been very profitable indeed, and the man, with his Bible in hand, along with the tract, and “Yet Forty Days” booklet, went on his way.<br>‍<br>Please pray for one team member that got sick yesterday.

Since most stores were closed, these venues were very crowded, and we were able to distribute close to 6000 tracts, and some “ Yet Forty Days.” <br>‍<br>Although we had a fine day of distributing tracts, the encounters we had were not as prolific as some of the other days. One of the teams started out again in the bustling San Martin Plaza, and as usual there was another demonstration in progress. However this time about 15 police with their riot shields in place were each given a tract by one of the team. Then we separated into two groups: one stayed in Plaza San Martin, while the other headed towards Plaza de Armas on the pedestrian-only walkway, and when we got to the Plaza de Armas, found that it was completely blocked off, and nobody could enter in for quite awhile. We were informed that it was due to a protest, but we did not see or hear anything to that would substantiate that. <br><br>The group then continued down another busy street, but at the end there were hardly any pedestrians, so it was decided, to head back to Plaza de Armas by another route. as we did so, a young man is his 20’s was given a tract, and seemed very excited about receiving it, and asked what it was about. The team member explained the purpose of the tract, and the young man asked if we were part of a local church somewhere. The team member replied that EBF was not connected with any church or denomination whatsoever, and stated that all churches and denominations were under God’s wrath, to which the young man agreed. They spoke a little longer and the team member gave him a “Yet Forty Days” booklet, and reminded him of EBF’s website, for which the young man thanked him enthusiastically.<br>‍<br>Another team member mentioned that while were passing out the remaining tracts for the day, 6 young men and women approached one of the team to explain what the tract was all about. This particular team member’s Spanish is minimal, and so she asked, “Do none of you speak English?” One of the young men replied tongue in cheek by saying in English, “ I am sorry, we do not speak a English.” The team member who had to leave shortly by taxi back to our hotel with the  rest of the group encouraged them to go to EBF’s website to learn more. Then they asked if she had any English tracts, and she gave them all one, for which they were very grateful.<br>‍<br>We also learned from one of the locals, that when they pass out their tracts, there is always a charge involved, and so he encouraged us to say hat the tracts were “gratis,” or free, so we will have to test this out to see if this is really the case.<br>‍<br>Please pray for the one team member who has been sick...she is flying back to the US tonight.<br><br></em><strong><em>The EBF Tract Team in Lima, Peru</em></strong></p></div></div><div data-w-tab="Tab 5" class="tab-pane-tab-1-15 w-tab-pane"><div class="container-9 w-container"><h1 class="heading-15"><strong class="bold-text-31">DAY 5 - LIMA</strong></h1><h3 class="heading-16">July 30, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em>“</em><strong><em>And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.”</em></strong><em>  (Revelation 10:11)<br><br> <br>Before reporting on how this day unfolded, we wanted to mention something regarding the team members themselves which is important, and especially relevant  for anybody considering going on a tract trip. All of us come from different backgrounds, job and life experiences, different personalities, strengths as well as weaknesses, and, ultimately, what God has ordained for each of our lives in terms of His overall timeline for the spiritual growth and maturity of each of His beloved sheep. As an example, two members on this tract trip lost loved ones on the same day, just prior to the departure of our trip to Lima - one was a niece, and the other a sister. It would have been understandable, under such heart-wrenching circumstances, to have stayed behind, and not go on the trip (even though money for airline tickets and hotel room deposits are only refundable within a certain narrow window, and changes can incur additional fees). However, these individuals felt in their “heart of hearts” that God wanted them here in Lima for His own purposes in their lives, and so they “left [their] nets”(Matthew 4:20) to follow the Master. <br><br>Although not all the team members, including one who was sick (and had to fly home last night) sustained the same degree of loss; nonetheless, each did have to give up their regular day-to-day routine that their individual family, job, and world revolves around, in order to follow this new commission “to feed sheep,” that God has commanded in this present, prolonged day of judgment. In answering Peter’s question in verse 27, “Behold we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? the Lord Jesus uttered these words in Matthew 19:29, “And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name&#x27;s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.” Although there is much joy and fellowship among the brethren on such a trip as this, the work can be grueling at times, the hours can be long, your are in a different country, with a unique language, different food and customs - in a completely diverse environment and  unless you are a well seasoned traveller, you are outside of your “comfort zone, “ which will cause you to depend on the Lord more and more, as you learn to identify with the admonition that the Lord gave to the Apostle Paul (and by extension to each child of God) in 2 Corinthians 12:9,“And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: </em><strong><em>for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</em></strong><em>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.”<br><br>With that in mind, here are some highlights from today’s distribution: <br>‍<br>One of the teams headed for the Plaza San Martin and Plaza de Armas, and even though today was the first work day after the three day holiday, they were able to pass out all their tracts, with very good reception. In fact as one of the female team members was passing by the National Palace, where 6 guards with rifles were standing guard. One of them motioned to the team member to come over, as he wanted a tract, and thanked her profusely. A similar incident happened when she handed an elderly woman a tract, and she read the title and then immediately turned over the tract to look at the websites, and then lifted her finger toward Heaven in gratitude to God for having received the tract.<br>‍<br>The other team headed off to a major shopping center south of Lima today, and there they too, found the reception rate was quite good. Six “Yet Forty Days”  booklets were distributed, and there were a couple of discussions regarding the free will gospel with individuals from churches. However one particular man was selling slices of home-made cake that were individually wrapped in cellophane. One of the team had given him a tract and he began reading it with great interest, while holding the platter with cake slices in the other hand, and whenever anybody came by, he would say perfunctorily, “hecho en casa,” or “home-made, “ while he kept reading until he had read the entire tract. Before he left, the team member gave him a “Yet Forty Days” booklet.<br>We also ordered more tracts today from the printer, as we are running low; please pray that we will be able to receive them in a timely manner.<br>‍<br>We are immensely grateful for the Lord’s leading and direction to reach His sheep here with His Word.<br>‍<br></em><strong><em>The EBF Tract Team in Lima, Peru</em></strong></p></div></div><div data-w-tab="Tab 6" class="tab-pane-tab-1-15 w-tab-pane"><div class="container-9 w-container"><h1 class="heading-15"><strong class="bold-text-31">DAY 6 - LIMA</strong></h1><h3 class="heading-16">July 31, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><strong><em>“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, [which is] your reasonable service.  {2} And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” </em></strong><em>(Romans 12:1-2)<br><br>‍<br>Once again, our two teams headed in different directions, in order to canvas as many different areas of the city as possible. One team went west to another very large mega mall, called Plaza San Miguel. It seems that these gigantic mega malls are very popular in Lima, as we have already visited three of them. That team was made up of five team members, who then split again into two smaller groups, one of which stood by one very large mall entrance on the sidewalk; while the other group stationed themselves across the street from the other mall entrances in front of two busy bus stops, where passengers were either going to or returning from the mall. Here are some reports from the team that went to Plaza San Miguel:<br>‍<br>One of the team recounted that he had met  two people, back-to- back, who asked him the “standard” question that every member of the team inevitably gets asked: “Who are we?” and “What are we doing?” The other variation of this line of questioning is: “What church are you a part of?” and “What is this [tract] all about?” The team member ended up giving both of these individuals the “Yet Forty Days” booklet, and encouraged them to read along with their Bibles in hand; he also emphasized the necessity of comparing “spiritual with spiritual,” as God’s methodology for studying His Holy Word.<br>‍<br>One female team member gave a man a tract, saying it was free, or “gratis,” and, later he came back to thank her, and in perfect English said, “God bless you!” Incidentally, we started implementing this word, “free” as we spoke with people, and the reaction was positive.<br>‍<br>Another female team member mentioned that one of the cab drivers caught her eye by waving and honking as he wanted a tract - even though he had passengers in the back seat - and then he took off immediately. As usual, a number of cab drivers gladly accepted the tracts. The title of the tract, clearly resonates with many people, and they are quick to tell us, or express their appreciation by a hearty handshake, or by offering their sincere thanks.<br>‍<br>Another team member reported that he had given a tract and a “Yet Forty Days” booklet to a female security guard, who began reading the tract, and later came back to ask for two more tracts, and two more booklets. Encounters like these are so very encouraging, and yet we know that even if someone is not able to express themselves outwardly for us to see - because they are in a hurry - or some other reason - it does not mean that they will not be impacted by the Scriptures, as we trust God implicitly that the</em><strong><em>“Shepherdof the sheep”</em></strong><em>will make sure they get into the hands of those for whom it is intended.<br>‍<br>Here are some more accounts from the other team that headed toward the center of Lima today, which is a prime place in which to pass out tracts, and always filled with an abundance of pedestrians:<br>A young man in his late 20’s approached the team leader to ask “What is this all about?” He spoke some English, and the team leader some Spanish, so they were able to communicate pretty well, even though the overall conversation was relatively short. As it turns out, this  man was from Venezuela (by the way there are some 3 million Venezuelan refugees in Lima we were told by onecab driver today), and he was most interested in the title of the tract, as he could certainly relate, given the turmoil that is in his own native country, as he spoke of how bad things were back home. He adamantly stated three times that he was going to read the tract.<br>‍<br>One of the other female team members said that she had an almost identical encounter as she had yesterday, when yet another one of the palace guards motioned for her to give him a tract, which she gladly obliged. This same team member remarked that a few individuals who spoke very good English thanked her profusely for the tracts, or tapped her on the shoulder for one, and this happened to the rest of the team as well on a daily basis.<br>‍<br>We were told by the printer that the tracts we had ordered will not be ready until 5:30 PM this evening, so Lord willing, we will go out to tonight to distribute them.<br>‍<br></em><strong><em>The EBF Tract Team in Lima, Peru</em></strong><em><br></em></p></div></div><div data-w-tab="Tab 7" class="tab-pane-tab-1-15 w-tab-pane w--tab-active"><div class="container-9 w-container"><h1 class="heading-15"><strong class="bold-text-31">DAY 7 - LIMA</strong></h1><h3 class="heading-16">August 1, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em>“</em><strong><em>And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: {26} And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?”</em></strong><em>(Matthew 12:25-26)<br><br>‍<br>By God’s provision, we did receive half of the tracts this evening that we had ordered and we will receive the other half on Saturday. One of the teams went back to the busy Center of Lima, while the other team went to an extremely busy intersection where a number of streets converge, and the distribution went exceedingly well, and we were able to empty out our backpacks completely. The latter team did not have any reports to mention, other than the amazing reception rate, for which we give God all the praise. Another team member who was scheduled to leave today, flew back to the States, and so we are now down to 8 team members for the rest of our time here in Lima - 4 more full days and a half a day on next Tuesday (6th) - which is also the day of our departure.<br>‍<br>Here are some reports from downtown Lima:<br>One of the female team members mentioned that a young man took the tract and asked “What is this all about?” and she directed him to the website, and he said that he would check it out. This also happened to a young woman who had rushed out of a store, and yet took the time to take the tract, and chat briefly.<br>Another team member recounted a conversation he began with a young man about the end of the church age, as he did not understand it, because at times he went to church himself. He also asked what Bible was the best to use, and the team member stated that the King James Version or the Reina Valera 1602 (or the 1909) would be the best. As this man spoke really good English, another couple who overheard their conversation were curious and joined the conversation, as they too recognized that God was no longer using the churches. <br>‍<br>The leader of the team said that he had met two Venezuelans - one who was part of a group of two Peruvians, and one Colombian; the other was a single man. Both Venezuelans, as stated in yesterday’s report, could certainly relate to the title of the tract, given the tremendous turmoil that exists in their own country, which is why they have had to flee to Peru. <br>‍<br>Another female team member recounted that she had met some students who were interested in practicing English, and when the team member explained about the website and the opportunity to ask Bible questions, one of them replied, “Oh, that would be a double blessing, we can practice our English, and learn about God at the same time?”<br>‍<br>We thank God for the foregoing encounters, and for the privilege that God has given us to “feed” His sheep here in Lima.<br></em><strong><em>‍<br>The EBF Tract Team in Lima, Peru</em></strong><em><br></em></p></div></div><div data-w-tab="Tab 8" class="tab-pane-tab-1-15 w-tab-pane"><div class="container-9 w-container"><h1 class="heading-15"><strong class="bold-text-31">DAY 8 - LIMA</strong></h1><h3 class="heading-16">August 2, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><em><br></em>“<strong><em>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.”</em></strong>(Revelation 22:11)<br>‍<br>Sincewe have arrived in Peru the weather has been overcast every day, but wonderfully, the sun came out for a short while during the afternoon, and it was truly a delight to see and feel the warmth of the sun and the beautiful blue sky for a change, as the weather has been somewhat chilly. One is reminded of Ecclesiastes 11:7, on a physical level, even though the more significant truth that underlies this verse has to do with the Lord Jesus Christ, Who is indeed the “Sun of Righteousness,” and the Word of God is spiritual “Light,” or Truth: <em>“Truly the light [is] sweet, and a pleasant [thing it is] for the eyes to behold the sun:</em><br><br>Today the entire team headed out initially to the very busy intersection where half of the team went to yesterday evening, once we received the partial order of tracts. All of us spread out to maximize our area of coverage, and here are some of the individuals that God allowed our paths to cross:<br>One of the team shared that he had met a young man from Colombia, who now lives in Lima on a visa. He wanted to call into EBF’s Question and Answer program, as he had a number of questions; he also asked for two other tracts to share with his family.<br>‍<br>Another team member recounted that he had met a “traffic policeman” who wanted to know who we represented. The team member pointed to the EBF website on the back of the tract, and explained that EBF is not associated with any church or denomination. The man then replied that hat he had left the Catholic Church many years ago, because of their worship of “saints.” He stated that he was looking for faithful Bible studies.<br>Another female team member reported that she had held out a tract to a well dressed man, who was staring at it, and then proceeded to take a tract out of his pocket, and began to tear it up in little pieces. The team member held out her hands to the man, as if to say, “I’ll throw it way,” but he refused, and walked away. On the heels of that isolated incident, one of the many smaller buses that are constantly dropping off and picking up people, stopped. Each of these buses has a man or woman who is designated to shout out the various major venues where the bus stops, and this man motioned to the team member that he wanted a tract, and surprisingly, exclaimed, “free”? when she told him the tracts were “gratis.” Then some other people on the bus reached out their hands for a tract, and the first man said - pointing to the rest of the team who were wearing the same T-shirts, and bringing his hands together as if praying - asked God to bless the team.<br>‍<br>One of the teams got a bite to eat, while the other team headed back to downtown Lima to pass out more tracts. While in the restaurant, a man and woman who were seated nearby kept looking at us and smiling. One of our Spanish speakers sensed that perhaps they wanted to ask something of the team, and so he greeted them politely, and asked if he could be of some assistance. As it turns out this couple is Peruvian, but they live in New Jersey. They were here in Lima temporarily as they own property. They also mentioned that they have two adult children that also live in New Jersey, and are in the medical and banking fields. The team member had mentioned they we were staying in a nearby hotel, and they knew the name of it; they asked if we could leave some tracts for them at the front desk tomorrow, and they gave us their name and address. One of the team, sensing that there is “no time like the present,” volunteered to go to the hotel, and get the tracts and “Yet Forty Days” booklets to give to them, as the hotel was just five minutes away, and they were so very happy to get the materials and thanked us profusely.<br>‍<br>Here are some more accounts from the team that went to downtown Lima:<br>One of the female team members related that she had met a young man, who was quite interested, and asked the standard question, “What is this all about?” and she directed him to the website on the back of the tract, and he said he would check it out. By contrast, another man came by who also asked “Is this a Catholic organization?” and the team member said, “no.” At that point the man appeared somewhat disgusted, and walked away.<br>‍<br>Like the theme verse at the top of this report, we see the tremendous anger of the non-elect at the message we are declaring, and at the same time the humble and joyful acceptance of the tract by many, who at least outwardly, give the appearance of being one of God’s elect sheep.<br>‍<br><strong>The EBF Tract Team in Lima, Peru</strong></p></div></div><div data-w-tab="Tab 9" class="tab-pane-tab-1-15 w-tab-pane"><div class="container-9 w-container"><h1 class="heading-15"><strong class="bold-text-31">DAY 9 - LIMA</strong></h1><h3 class="heading-16">August 3, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35">“<strong><em>But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? 8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? {9} Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. {10} So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.” </em></strong>(Luke 17:7-10) <br>‍<br>At breakfast this morning, we witnessed something interesting on the wall mounted TV that is set to CNN in Spanish. A documentary on the rise of the white supremacy movement in the US was being featured; additionally, the report showed the rise of violence between opposing factions in other parts of the world, particularly in England and Sweden. At one point in the documentary the word,<strong>“DIVIDIDO,” (DIVIDED) </strong>appeared in bold letters across the screen, reinforcing the title of the tract we are passing out, and the powerful Scriptural reality that Satan’ s kingdom is being systematically dismantled and shamed in the eyes of the world, one institution at a time. <br>‍<br>One of the team met a couple as he was standing outside of our hotel passing out tracts. The husband was Peruvian, and the wife Bolivian. The team member said that he had a good conversation with them that lasted 30 minutes. They agreed with what the tract was saying, and the end of the church age, as they felt that the churches were only interested in financial gain. The man had additional questions regarding having only a “little bit of wine,” for example. The team member responded by going to Proverbs 31:4, which prohibits “kings” (who represent the elect) from imbibing liquor. The wife then turned to her husband, and gave him a look, as if to say, “See, I told you so.” The husband also wanted to know the telephone number (which is in English) of EBF’s Q and A, so that he could call in: (701) 801-9989. They asked the team member where all the team was from, and he said from different parts of the US, and they were surprised that even though we came from different parts of the country we convened in Lima for the express purpose to “feed God’s sheep” with the Word of God.<br>‍<br>Once again we split up into two groups - one team headed for downtown Lima, while the other to the very busy intersection that we had been frequenting the last few days. However when that team arrived at the very busy intersection, they were told by one of the state police that they had to move two blocks down from there, either to the left or to the right. So, it was decided that they would move to the right, as on the taxi ride there, they had passed a very busy bus terminal, so they ended up there. Here are some of the individuals that they encountered there:<br>‍<br>One team member reported that he was approached by a woman who was very upset because she saw a number of tracts on the street. She exclaimed, “They are throwing down the Word of God!”<br>Another team member recounted that a young man came up to him to ask for three tracts for some of his family members, and the team member gladly obliged.<br>‍<br>Here are some of the individuals that the team who went to downtown Lima encountered:<br>One of the female team members recalled a man whom she had given a tract to, who came back to ask for two more tracts; he also returned a third time to ask for three more additional tracts, and he was very happy to get them all. This same team member remembered one incident, in which she ran into a man that only spoke Spanish, and was saying something that the team member could not comprehend; some others came up and explained that what the man was curious about was if the tract was “free,” and she smiled and emphatically said, “Yes!” <br>‍<br>One of the other female team members reported that a man she had given a tract to, came back and kept talking, and she told him that she did not speak Spanish. He was curious about the date of May 21, 2011, which the tract speaks about, and she replied that marked the beginning of the day of judgment, and she also directed him to the website.<br>‍<br>One team member recorded that she offered a woman a tract, and she asked in English, “Where are you from?” And the team member replied, “Kentucky.” She said she was from Minnesota. The woman asked, “What are you here for?” And she told her, and she exclaimed, “That’s what we’re here for, because of the Pan American Games.” As it turned out, the woman was from a Baptist church, and they were passing out their own literature. The team member replied that God finished using the churches and denominations, and that they under His wrath. The woman took offense and said, “I’m a New Testament Baptist.” The team member replied, “I used to be a Baptist.” The team member noticed that this woman was getting angry, and started glaring at the other EBF team members who were passing out tracts at a furious pace, whereas the tracts that she and her colleagues were attempting to distribute very few people were taking. She ended up by saying,<strong>“There is no authority here!” <br>‍</strong><br>Another team member said that he had met a 79-year old man who claimed to be a “new Christian,” who did not go to a church. Struggling in English, he said “I only read my Bible.” They also started talking about the timeline, and how to compare, “spiritual with spiritual.” The team member concluded that he felt truly blessed by the conversation, and how mutually profitable it was for both of them.<br>‍<br>Another man who spoke Spanish approached one of the team, and kept repeating the same question, “What about mother Mary...what do you think.” The team member explained that the church age was over, and directed the man to the website.<br>‍<br>There were a number of other encounters in which multiple people asked for extra tracts, as well as smaller children who were walking with their parents, and even though the parents were not interested, they held out their little hands for a tract.

One of the things that we attempt to do after we are done passing out tracts is to pick up any that were discarded on the ground.<br>‍<br>Another team member mentioned that he had a few people come up and ask the standard questions, and appreciated the work we were doing, and thanked us or asked God to bless our efforts. <br>One unusual thing is that from time to time, people will come up to us to either give money or food, as happened twice to another team member who protested that we absolutely want nothing in return, as that would be “merchandizing” the Gospel, which we have “freely he have received,” and which we “freely give,” according to Matthew 10:8.<br><br>By God’s mercy, the reception rate continues to be very good.<br>‍<br><strong>The EBF Tract Team in Lima, Peru</strong><br><br></p></div></div><div data-w-tab="Tab 12" class="tab-pane-tab-1-15 w-tab-pane"><div class="container-9 w-container"><h1 class="heading-15"><strong class="bold-text-31">DAY 12 - LIMA</strong></h1><h3 class="heading-16">August 6, 2019</h3><p class="paragraph-35"><br><strong><em>“And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to [his] purpose. {29} For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. {30} Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.” </em></strong>(Romans 8:28-30)<br>‍<br>One of our team members had to leave this morning on an early flight so the rest of the team stayed local, and reception was still very good. The rest of the team will leave tonight around midnight.<br>We thank the Lord for putting together a wonderful cohesive team. We all worked well together and helped each other out, and we truly give God the glory for what He accomplished in Lima, and for His ongoing work in the hearts of His elect sheep there. By His mercy, the team was able to distribute 124,500 tracts and a few dozen “Yet Forty Days” booklets.<br>‍<br>P. S. One of the team had her flight delayed, thus missing her connecting flight.
